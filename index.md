# What Is Magic: The Gathering?

Magic: The Gathering is a card game that has been around from 1993, its first release and has been played by people for almost 3 decades. It is a game with many mechanics and there are more than 20,000 unique cards in the game to date. There are 5 different colors of cards in the game; White, Black, Red, Blue, and Green. There are cards that use a mix of these colors and even cards that don't use any of them, in other words colorless cards.

## How to Start a Magic Game

1. You need to buy a deck from somewhere. Starter decks can be found at Targets and Walmarts, among other locations. I would personally recommend going to a card-only selling store as going to the places I just mentioned usually have a small variety. Of course, you can also buy them online, which makes the search much less taxing, but I have heard that boxes have gotten mixed up before.

2. Create your own deck or edit a starter deck you have bought if you decided to get more cards after buying a starter. I would personally recommend making a 1 or 2 colored deck as those are usually easier to play and therefore better for people who haven't played before.

3. Find a friend to play with as that is the requirement for most games, if you don't have anyone, the MTG website has a function to search for people who are interested in playing and need a partner. I am a lucky person as I have multiple people interested so I have never used this function before and I am sorry if something is different from what I describe here about the website's function.

4. Shuffle each of your decks throughly and then draw 7 cards. There are certain types of cards in the game and I will get to that later. All you need to know is that if you don't have at least 2 land cards in your hand I would suggest mulliganing. To take a mulligan, a player shuffles the cards in their hand back into their library, draws a new hand of cards equal to their starting hand size, then puts a number of those cards equal to the number of times that player has taken a mulligan on the bottom of their library in any order. For example if you mulliganed 2 time then you have to put 2 of the cards you redrew at the bottom of the deck.

5. Next, decide on a person who would go first. While going first may seem advantageous, you aren't allowed to draw if you do so until your next turn. This can be bad for some who mulliganed against someone who had not. Anyways, anyone who plays after the first person is allowed to draw a card on their first turn.

The above image describes the 5 phases of a player's turn. The begin and end phases aren't that important as those phases are just systematic. The main phase, the attack phase, and the end phase are the real meat and bones. The main phase allows you to place down a land, a mana producing source of at least one of color, in most land cases as there are some that only give colorless mana. If you have enough lands (which are a card type) untapped to play a creature, sorcery, enchantment, artifact, or instant. The image below decribes how to read a card much better than I could ever do.

As seen from the image a card has a cost. In the example above, the 1 represents mana of any color while the 1 red symbol represents a red mana. So, the card would have a total cost of 2 mana, with one of them needing to be a red mana. 

Anyways, the attacking phase has attacking and blocking creatures. The attacking units are the ones that the player that is currently playing owns and the blockers are the ones from the other players not currently on their turn. When a creature attacks, unless they have Vigilance, a static ability to prevent tapping, the creature taps and therefore won't be able to block the on the enemy player's next turn or use any abilities that require them to tap.
