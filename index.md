# What Is Magic: The Gathering?

Magic: The Gathering is a card game that has been around from 1993, its first release and has been played by people for almost 3 decades. It is a game with many mechanics and there are more than 20,000 unique cards in the game to date. There are 5 different colors of cards in the game; White, Black, Red, Blue, and Green. There are cards that use a mix of these colors and even cards that don't use any of them, in other words colorless cards.

## How to Start a Magic Game

1. You need to buy a deck from somewhere. Starter decks can be found at Targets and Walmarts, among other locations. I would personally recommend going to a card-only selling store as going to the places I just mentioned usually have a small variety. Of course, you can also buy them online, which makes the search much less taxing, but I have heard that boxes have gotten mixed up before.

2. Create your own deck or edit a starter deck you have bought if you decided to get more cards after buying a starter. I would personally recommend making a 1 or 2 colored deck as those are usually easier to play and therefore better for people who haven't played before.

3. Find a friend to play with as that is the requirement for most games, if you don't have anyone, the MTG website has a function to search for people who are interested in playing and need a partner. I am a lucky person as I have multiple people interested so I have never used this function before and I am sorry if something is different from what I describe here about the website's function.

4. Shuffle each of your decks throughly and then draw 7 cards. There are certain types of cards in the game and I will get to that later. All you need to know is that if you don't have at least 2 land cards in your hand I would suggest mulliganing. To take a mulligan, a player shuffles the cards in their hand back into their library, draws a new hand of cards equal to their starting hand size, then puts a number of those cards equal to the number of times that player has taken a mulligan on the bottom of their library in any order. For example if you mulliganed 2 time then you have to put 2 of the cards you redrew at the bottom of the deck.

5. Next, decide on a person who would go first. While going first may seem advantageous, you aren't allowed to draw if you do so until your next turn. This can be bad for some who mulliganed against someone who had not. Anyways, anyone who plays after the first person is allowed to draw a card on their first turn.

## Playing Magic

The above image describes the 5 phases of a player's turn. The begin and end phases aren't that important as those phases are just systematic. The main phase, the attack phase, and the second main phase are the real meat and bones. The main phase allows you to place down a land, a mana producing source of at least one of color, in most land cases as there are some that only give colorless mana. If you have enough lands (which are a card type) untapped to play a creature, sorcery, enchantment, artifact, or instant. The image below decribes how to read a card much better than I could ever do.

![1_m1feqHB3FbymQTJsWSqF5A](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105888980/169731458-dec41028-0f31-4361-b90e-aaf8e3bdcda8.jpg)

As seen from the image a card has a cost. In the example above, the 1 represents mana of any color while the 1 red symbol represents a red mana. So, the card would have a total cost of 2 mana, with one of them needing to be a red mana. 

Anyways, the attacking phase has attacking and blocking creatures. The attacking units are the ones that the player that is currently playing owns and the blockers are the ones from the other players not currently on their turn. When a creature attacks, unless they have Vigilance, a static ability to prevent tapping, the creature taps and therefore won't be able to block the on the enemy player's next turn or use any abilities that require them to tap. When attacking, always be mindful of your creature's toughness and power, as seen in the example card above power and toughness are assigned to a card at the bottom right, with power being before the slash and toughness being after. If a blocking creature's toughness are more than an attacking creature's power then the attack can be negated without any damage to a player. You can block with a creature weaker than an attacking creature, but then the blocking creature would die from the damage. The opposite situations can occur with attacking creatures. Finally, you can also block with multiple creatures, but remember that blocking creatures have to be unblocked. Examples are below, these images are from the official Magic website.

Now that I described most of the attack phase, lets talk about the second main phase, a pretty easy phase if I do say so myself. The second main phase is literally a copy of the first one. If you haven't put down a land during your turn then you can put one down, if you wonder how you could get a kand card in your hand during the attack phase, some spells have abilities that let you do so and therefore allow this clause. If you have any lands untapped, you could also use their mana to play another card. That is all you need to know about turn phases.

## Static Abilities

Now I will talk about the different static abilities within the game, such as Vigilance which was talked about before. Below is a list of the non recent abilities and I will talk about only them as most starter packs shouldn't be using things such as Reconfigure or Connive (If you are curious about these abilities though search them up).

- Deathtouch just means that as long as a creature deals any amount of damage to another, it will die. Even 1 damage to a 20 health creature will cause the 20 toughness creature to perish.
- Defender just means that a creature can't attack on attack phases, only block.
- First strike means that a creature can attack before other creatures, but not attack when the other creature would be able to attack. Basically if a 3/1 creature with first strike attacked a creature with 1/3 without first strike, instead of mutual destruction, only the 1/3 creature would die.
- Double strike is just as it says, a creature can do a first strike and then also attack when other creatures can also attack. It basically also doubles a creature's attack as they can attack twice in an attacking phase.
- Flying creatures are creatures that can't be blocked unless by other flying creatures or creatures with reach.
- Indestructible is just as you would expect it, a creature can't die even if its toughness goes below 0. There are ways of going around this though, like exiling the card or using a spell that subtracts from the creature's power/toughness like -x/-x, which requires certain spells to do. If you are wondering why spells that subtracts from creatures' power/toughness works, it is simply because if a creature doesn't have health in the first place, how can it exist?
- Lifelink makes it that whatever damage a creature deals to a unit or player, the creature's controller gains that much life. If I controlled a 2/2 creature that has lifelink, then whenever it deals damage, I heal 2 health.
- Reach enables a creature to block flying creatures.
- Trample makes it so that instead of being able to block a 20/20 creature's damage with a small 1/1 creature, the damage that wasn't used to kill that creature is carried on to the enemy player. In the example I gave, a player would then take 19 damage as the attacking creature used 1 of its power to kill the 1/1 creature.
- Vigilance, as described before, makes it so that when a creature attacks, it doesn't tap. This means that the next enemy turn, it would still have the ability to defend even if it had attacked before.
- Menace makes it so that a creature isn't possible to block unless 2 creatures minimum are used. This can be useful early game if an enemy is having a hard time getting more than one creature on the field, you could keep attacking and they wouldn't be able to stop it. Before you think anything else though, Menace does not make it possible for a creature to block 2 attacking creatures, it only blocks 1 creature like other units.
- Hexproof, as you can see there are quite a few versions of hexproof. The main version of hexproof protects against any sorcery or instant that an enemy player controls would target a creature. In other words, creatures with hexproof can only be taken out attacking them with creatures or using spells that target everything on the battlefield. Different versions of hexproof seen in the image protect against only a specific color, so if an enemy has spells of multiple colors it doesn't help as much.

**Anyways that is all I want to cover on this little project**
