# What Is Magic: The Gathering?

Magic: The Gathering is a card game that has been around from 1993, its first release and has been played by people for almost 3 decades. It is a game with many mechanics and there are more than 20,000 unique cards in the game to date. There are 5 different colors of cards in the game; White, Black, Red, Blue, and Green. There are cards that use a mix of these colors and even cards that don't use any of them, in other words colorless cards.

## How to Start a Magic Game

1. You need to buy a deck from somewhere. Starter decks can be found at Targets and Walmarts, among other locations. I would personally recommend going to a card-only selling store as going to the places I just mentioned usually have a small variety. Of course, you can also buy them online, which makes the search much less taxing, but I have heard that boxes have gotten mixed up before.

2. Create your own deck or edit a starter deck you have bought if you decided to get more cards after buying a starter. I would personally recommend making a 1 or 2 colored deck as those are usually easier to play and therefore better for people who haven't played before.

3. Find a friend to play with as that is the requirement for most games, if you don't have anyone, the MTG website has a function to search for people who are interested in playing and need a partner. I am a lucky person as I have multiple people interested so I have never used this function before and I am sorry if something is different from what I describe here about the website's function.

4. Shuffle each of your decks throughly and then draw 7 cards. There are certain types of cards in the game and I will get to that later. All you need to know is that if you don't have at least 2 land cards in your hand I would suggest mulliganing. To take a mulligan, a player shuffles the cards in their hand back into their library, draws a new hand of cards equal to their starting hand size, then puts a number of those cards equal to the number of times that player has taken a mulligan on the bottom of their library in any order. For example if you mulliganed 2 time then you have to put 2 of the cards you redrew at the bottom of the deck.
